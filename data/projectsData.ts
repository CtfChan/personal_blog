    √çvarious topics. Some examples include: DWA, A* and RRT. A lot of the work here was inspired by PythonRobotics 
    from AtsushiSakai.`,

    description: `This was a group project for a robotics course.
    The objective of the project was to program a Turtlebot to autonomously explore a maze
    and map it using Gmapping. Our design used a combination of frontier exploration,
    bug algorithm and A\* to explore it's environment.`,

    title: 'Autonomous Pick and Go Rover',
    description: `This was a group project for a Mechatronics class. 
    The objective of the project was to design an autonomous rover that would find a 
    misplaced wooden block in a maze and place it at a goal point. 
    The robot's initial position was randomly chosen so 
    we had to solve the kidnapped robot problem.`,

    title: 'Autonomous Wheelchair Project',
    description: `I did this project during the summer of 2017 alongside my partner Ayaan at Lund 
    University. Using an Xbox Kinect, a laptop and some spare electronic parts we transformed an 
    electric wheelchair into an autonous navigation robot. This was my first full-fledged robotics 
    project and it was an excellent learning experience.`,
