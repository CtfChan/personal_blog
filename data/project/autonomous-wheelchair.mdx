I did this project during the summer of 2017 alongside my partner Ayaan at Lund
University. Using an Xbox Kinect, a laptop and some spare electronic parts we transformed an
electric wheelchair into an autonous navigation robot. This was my first full-fledged robotics
project and it was an excellent learning experience.
