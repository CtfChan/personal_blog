## Introduction

Quintic splines are a common path parametrization in robotics. A quintic polynomial is a 5th order polynomial. Each dimension $$(x, y)$$ is represented as a quintic polynomial. The coefficients $$a_i$$ and $$b_i$$ can be solved for provided we give the robot's start position, velocity and acceleration ($$x_s$$, $$v_s$$, $$a_s$$) as well as the end position, velocity and acceleration ($$x_f$$, $$v_f$$, $$a_f$$); these are also known the boundary conditions.

$$x(t) = a_o + a_1 t + a_2 t ^2 + a_3 t ^ 3 + a_4 t ^ 4 + a_5 t^5   $$

$$y(t) = b_o + b_1 t + b_2 t ^2 + b_3 t ^ 3 + b_4 t ^ 4 + b_5 t^5   $$

## Issues

There are discontinuities in the curvature paramatrization of quintic splines, which makes the curvature hard to constrain. From the equation of curvature $$k(t)$$ below, we can see that the denominator of the equation could be undefined.

$$k(t) = \frac{x'(t) y''(t) - y'(t)x''(t)}{ (x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2)^{3/2}  }$$

## Solving the Equation

Let us consider only $$x(t)$$. We can solve for $$a_i$$ provided that we are given the start position, velocity and acceleration ($$x_s$$, $$v_s$$, $$a_s$$) as well as the end position, velocity and acceleration ($$x_f$$, $$v_f$$, $$a_f$$); these are also known the boundary conditions of $$x(t)$$ 's zeroth, first and second derivative.

First derivative:
$$x'(t) = a_1 + 2 a_2 t  + 3 a_3 t ^ 2 + 4 a_4 t ^ 3 + 5 a_5 t^ 4   $$

Second derivative:
$$x''(t) = 2 a_2 t  +  6 a_3 t + 12 a_4 t ^ 2 + 20 a_5 t^ 3    $$

Using our initial boundary conditions for $t = 0$ we can easily solve for $$a_0$$, $$a_1$$, $$a_2$$.

$$x(0) = x_s = a_0 $$

$$x'(0) = v_s = a_1 $$

$$x''(0) = a_s = 2 a_2 $$

Now lets solve for $$a_3$$, $$a_4$$, $$a_5$$ using our boundary conditions of $$t = T$$.

Eqn 1: $$x(T) = x_e = a_o + a_1 T + a_2 T ^2 + a_3 T ^ 3 + a_4 T ^ 4 + a_5 T^5   $$

Eqn 2: $$x'(T) = v_e = a_1 + 2 a_2 T  + 3 a_3 T ^ 2 + 4 a_4 T ^ 3 + 5 a_5 T^ 4   $$

Eqn 3: $$x''(T) = a_e = 2 a_2 T  +  6 a_3 T + 12 a_4 T ^ 2 + 20 a_5 T^ 3    $$

Since we have already solved for $$a_0$$, $$a_1$$, $$a_2$$, we can rearrange (1), (2) and (3) to have all of our unknwons on the left and known variables on the right side of the equality.

Eqn 1: $$ a_3 T ^ 3 + a_4 T ^ 4 + a_5 T^5 = x_e - a_0 - a_1 T - a_2 T ^2 $$

Eqn 2: $$ 3 a_3 T ^ 2 + 4 a_4 T ^ 3 + 5 a_5 T^4 = v_e - a_1 - a_1 T - 2 a_2 T $$

Eqn 3: $$ 6 a_3 T + 12 a_4 T ^ 2 + 20 a_t T^3 = a_e - 2 a_2 $$

The three equations above can now be conveniently factored into a system of linear equations $Ax=b$.

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
T^3 & T^4 & T^5 \\
3T^2 & 4 T ^3 & 5 T ^ 4 \\
6T & 12 T ^2 & 20 T^3
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a_3 \\
a_4 \\
a_5
\end{pmatrix}
=\space
\begin{pmatrix}
x_e - a_0 - a_1 T - a_2 T ^2 \\
v_e - a_1 - a_1 T - 2 a_2 T \\
a_e - 2 a_2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Since $$T \geq 0$$ our A matrix will be invertible and we can solve for $$a_3$$, $$a_4$$, $$a_5$$ using $$x = A^{-1} b$$.
